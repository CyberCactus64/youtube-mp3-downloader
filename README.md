# Download you favourite songs from youtube! :)
This script uses the youtube_dl library, install it with pip:
`pip install --upgrade youtube-dl`

## Put your favourite songs links in songs.txt and run the script!

## FUTURE UPDATES:
 - Control statement that verifies if songs.txt is empty
 - Add a GUI
 - Read songs from a playlist
 - Any ideas?
